Answers is a python program which provides answers to the chemistry quiz provided in this repository in time-efficient and non too revealing way. I think we all can agree that if I want the answer to question n°1, this doen't necessarely mean that I want to read what the answer to the next question is.

Feel free to download this program if you ever have the same need.

## Download
I really don't think that you use linux, do you? If you really do you don't need this tutorial. So, if you're a Windows User, you can simply go and click on the green button on this web page which says `code` and then choose the option `download ZIP`.

After you've downloaded the zip you're almost there. Unzip it in a folder, open the folder in a terminal (on windows 11 you can simply right click and press `open in terminal`) and run:

```batch
> python main.py
```

## Usage
Write the number of the quiz you want the answer to. It will give you the correct answer. If the answer is not what you expected, you did the quiz wrong. *Never shall you doubt of my software* :)

Jokes aside, you can check the validity of the answers on the file `answers.dat`, those are correct. I checked myself and the program worked wihtout any issues.
